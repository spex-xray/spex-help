How to run SPEX
===============

SPEX is a spectral fitting program used to fit high-resolution X-ray
spectra. The code contains several simple and detailed models that are
able to deal with the radiative processes observed in the X-ray band.
Because SPEX has a command-line interface, a first-time user should get
familiar with the syntax of the commands to be able to work with it.
This chapter provides some basic commands and threads to fit X-ray
spectra.

The SPEX data format
--------------------

The data files containing the spectrum of the source and the response
need to be in the correct format. In the SPEX installation, we provide a
program called :ref:`sect:trafo` to convert OGIP standard fits files into SPEX
format (see :ref:`sect:runtrafo` for an explanation of how to use
trafo). In this chapter, we assume that you already have spectra in SPEX
format. For example, the `demo spectra from the SPEX web site
<https://www.sron.nl/astrophysics-spex/manual>`_.

SPEX needs two files per spectrum:

-  ``<filename>.spo`` – This file contains the countrate per energy bin
   for the source (:math:`D_i`), as well as the background countrate and
   the errors (:math:`\sigma_i`).

-  ``<filename>.res`` – This file contains the instrumental response:
   the energy redistribution and effective area (:math:`R_{ij}~ A_j`).

In order to calculate the observed model spectrum, SPEX uses this
integral equation to account for the imperfections caused by the
instrument:

.. math::
   D(c) =  \int R(c,E) A(E) S(E) dE
   :label: eq_data

.. math::

   D_i =  \sum_{j=1}^n R_{ij} A_j S_j
   

The ``.res`` and ``.spo`` files are so-called FITS files. This is a data
format widely used in Astronomy. FITS files can contain images as well
as data tables. The software package `FTOOLS
<https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/ftools/>`_ provided by NASA contains a
large number of tools to manipulate FITS files. If you
are interested, then you can launch ``flaunch`` to see which tools are
available. For more information about the SPEX spectrum and response
format see :ref:`sect:matrices`.

Loading spectra into SPEX
-------------------------

The SPEX program is started by entering ``spex`` in a linux terminal
window. In the following sections we describe one run of the program. To
start SPEX do this:

::

   user@linux:~> spex
    Welcome user to SPEX version 3.00.00

   SPEX> 

First, we have to load the data files. This is done using the ``data`` command
(:ref:`sec:data`). It is a general thing in SPEX that filename extensions are not
typed explicitly when issuing a command. If you have a file called
``filename.spo`` and ``filename.res`` then you type:

::

   SPEX> data filename filename

The responsefile (.res) is entered first and then the file containing
the spectrum (.spo). You can avoid confusion by giving the same filename
to both .res and .spo files. Remember that the order of the words in the
commands is very important!

To save you from typing a lot, many commands can be abbreviated by
typing just the first few characters. For example, ``da`` is equivalent
to ``dat`` and ``data``.

Plotting the data
-----------------

If the ``data`` command was successful, we can now have a look at the
spectra. SPEX offers a lot of different plot commands (see :ref:`sec:plot`).
Using default settings, the easiest way of plotting a spectrum is as follows::

   SPEX> plot dev xs
   SPEX> plot type data
   SPEX> plot

The sequence above opens a PGPLOT window (``plot dev xs``) and tells SPEX that we
want to plot the spectral data (``plot type data``). This will create a linear-linear
plot in keV units.

The plot can be tailored to your wishes. Below is an example to change the
plot to a linear-linear plot in Å and add a title to the plot::

   SPEX> plot x lin
   SPEX> plot y lin
   SPEX> plot ux a
   SPEX> plot uy a
   SPEX> plot rx 8.:35.
   SPEX> plot ry 0.:0.05
   SPEX> plot set 1
   SPEX> plot cap ut text "This is my plot"
   SPEX> plot cap lt disp false
   SPEX> plot cap id disp false
   SPEX> plot

To make sure the axes are linear, we give the commands (``plot x lin`` and
``plot y lin``) and change the axes to unit Å (``plot ux a`` and ``plot uy a``).
The commands ``plot rx 8.:35.`` and ``plot ry 0.:0.05`` change the
ranges on the x and y axes, respectively. Then the color of the data,
background spectrum and model are set. The last commands beginning with
``plot cap`` remove some standard titles and other text around the plot.
After you define the plot like in the example above, you can plot it
with a single ``plot`` command.

The y-axis in this plot is in :math:`\mathrm{counts}` :math:`\mathrm{s}^{-1}`
:math:`\mathrm{Å}^{-1}`. Ångstrom is not the only unit used in high-energy
astrophysics. Usually, the energy of the photons is expressed in keV.
In SPEX you can use keV by writing ``k`` instead of ``a`` in all commands.
For example, ``plot ux k`` to use keV for the x-axis. An overview of
possible units is provided in :ref:`sect:plotaxes`.

Ignoring and rebinning
----------------------

High-resolution X-ray spectra from Chandra and XMM-Newton are usually
oversampled (e.g. the energy bins are much smaller than the spectral
resolution) and contain a lot more channels then is useful. Therefore,
it is necessary to remove wavelength intervals which contain bad data
and rebin your spectrum. The SPEX command to ignore parts of the spectrum
is called ``ignore`` (:ref:`sec:ignore`) and the command to rebin is called
``bin`` (:ref:`sec:bin`). In the next example we bin the spectrum over
the 8–35 Å range with a factor of 5 and ignore the rest of the
spectrum:

::

   ign 0:8 unit a
   ign 35:100 unit a
   bin 8:35 5 unit a

The words ``unit a`` tells SPEX that the ranges (for example 8.0:35.0)
are given in Å. If you work with more than one spectrum (from more than
one instrument), you can add an extra instrument statement:

::

   ign ins 1:2 0:8 unit a
   ign ins 1:2 35:100 unit a
   bin ins 1:2 8:35 5 unit a

Here, instrument 1 to 2 are binned with a factor of 5 over the 8–35 Å
range.

Defining a model
----------------

Now we have a clean and rebinned spectrum that is ready to fit. Before
we can start fitting, we first need to define a model. It’s equivalent
to :math:`S(E)` in Eq. :eq:`eq_data`. The model can contain
one or more of these components:

-  ``absm`` Model for interstellar absorption.

-  ``reds`` Redshift.

-  ``po`` Powerlaw.

-  ``ga`` Gaussian.

And there are more (see :ref:`chap:specmod`)! The following command sequence
defines a simple powerlaw model at a certain redshift and absorbed by
the interstellar medium. The individual components of the model are
loaded one-by-one with the ``com`` command (:ref:`sec:comp`):

::

   SPEX> com reds
   SPEX> com absm
   SPEX> com po
   SPEX> com rel 3 1,2

The last command (``com rel 3 1,2``) tells SPEX that component 3, the
powerlaw, is first redshifted by component 1 and then absorbed by
component 2. The order of the 1 and the 2 is important! Always think
what happens in which order on the way from the source to the telescope.

For most sources the distance is more or less known. To get a right
luminosity estimate for the source, the expected distance has to be
provided to SPEX. This is done with the ``distance`` command
(:ref:`sec:distance`)::

   SPEX> dist 0.1 z
   Distances assuming H0 =  50.0 km/s/Mpc and q0 = 0.500
   Sector    m      A.U.        ly        pc       kpc       Mpc  redshift        cz
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   1 1.894E+25 1.266E+14 2.002E+09 6.139E+08 6.139E+05  613.8689    0.1000   29979.2
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this command, the distance to the source is set to a redshift of
0.1. The derived distances for this cosmology are in the output of the
``dist`` command.

Now we have to estimate the initial parameters. With the command
``par show`` we can see which parameters there are::

   SPEX> par show
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   sect comp mod  acro parameter with unit     value      status    minimum   maximum

We can set the parameters using the ``par`` command (:ref:`sec:par`). The first “1” in
column “sect” can usually be ignored. The commands then look like this:

::

   SPEX> par 1 z val 0.1
   SPEX> par 2 nh val 2.E-3
   SPEX> par 3 norm val 1.E+10
   SPEX> par gamm val 1.5

The last component number used is saved, so in the last line we can skip
typing the number 3 after ``par``. Then, we run ``par show`` again to
see what happened:

::

   SPEX> par show
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Finding the right initial values for the parameters is a game of trial
and error. To see whether you are going in the right direction, you can
calculate the model with the command ``calc`` and ``plot`` again (:ref:`sec:calculate`).
If you see the model appear in your screen, then the model is close enough to
be fitted. Especially the normalization of the powerlaw (``3 norm``) can
vary a lot depending on the count rate of the source.

Fitting the data
----------------

We are ready to fit the data! SPEX has a nice feature to look at the
progress of the fit. To activate this feature you have to give the
command ``fit print 1`` (see :ref:`sec:fit`). If your initial parameters
were acceptable, you can see the model converge to the data in the plot
window after you entered the ``fit`` command. When the fit is done, then
the parameters and C-stat are printed on screen. If the C-stat value is
close to the expected C-stat value, then your fit is acceptable.
Sometimes more runs of the command ``fit`` are necessary after changing
some initial parameters. This is especially true when using complex
models. Again this is a game of trial and error.

You also might want to fix or free certain parameters to see if they can
be constrained. In SPEX fixing is ``f`` (frozen) and freeing is ``t``
(thawn). You can free the redshift and fix the :math:`N_{\mathrm{H}}` by
the following commands:

::

   SPEX> par 1 z stat t
   SPEX> par 2 nh stat f

Calculating errors
------------------

When the fit is acceptable, you might want to know the uncertainties on
your fitted parameters. Errors are determined one-by-one by fixing the
parameter to some value and calculate the :math:`\Delta` C-stat with
respect to the best fit. If you want to know the 1\ :math:`\sigma` error
on the parameter, you need to know its values at :math:`\Delta` C-stat =
1. This is done by the ``error`` command (:ref:`sec:error`). You
can calculate the error for each parameter. For example redshift:

::

   SPEX> error 1 z

If you need another :math:`\Delta` C-stat limit (not recommended), then
you can set the desired :math:`\Delta` C-stat in SPEX using the command:
``error dchi 1.``

Making life easier
------------------

In this short manual you have seen a lot of commands, but to avoid
typing too much you want to use some identical series of commands every
time you fit a certain spectrum. For example, you don’t want to type all
plot commands again when making a plot. Therefore, the program has a
command to solve this problem called ``log`` (see :ref:`sec:log`).
With the command ``log exe filename`` you
can execute a number of commands at the same time. The numbers are read
from a normal text file with (in this case) the name ``filename.com``.
Again the extension ``.com`` should not be typed explicitly. Below is an
example to setup a plot for an EPIC spectrum (range 0.2–10.0 keV) with a
small frame that shows residuals. Note that you can put any command in
such a command file and you can make comment lines by putting a # sign
in front of the line.

::

   # This is a command file that creates a plot with residuals.
   plot dev xs
   plot type data
   plot x log
   plot y log
   plot rx 0.2:10.
   plot ry 0.0001:10.
   plot back disp t
   plot set 1
   plot data col 1
   plot model col 2
   plot back col 1
   plot set all
   plot frame new
   plot frame 2
   plot type chi
   plot uy rel
   plot x log
   plot rx 0.2:10.
   plot ry -0.5:0.5
   plot view def f
   plot view x 0.08:0.92
   plot view y 0.1:0.3
   plot cap y text "Rel. Error"
   plot cap ut disp f
   plot cap lt disp f
   plot cap id disp f
   plot frame 1
   plot view def f
   plot view x 0.08:0.92
   plot view y 0.3:0.9
   plot cap x disp f
   plot cap id disp f
   plot cap ut disp f
   plot box numlab bot f

Saving your work
----------------

There are several ways in SPEX you can save your work. Below you find a
few examples to save your commands, output or plots.

Saving a plot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These commands open a PostScript plot device with filename
``filename.ps``, then they plot your figure in the PS file and closes
the device:

::

   SPEX> plot dev cps filename.ps
   SPEX> plot
   SPEX> plot close 2

Saving commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to save all commands that you execute to an ASCII file
(``filename.com``), then type ``log save filename`` (see also :ref:`sec:log`).
Do not forget to close the file at the end of the session by typing
``log close save``. The saved commands in the textfile can be executed again by the
``log exe filename`` command.

Saving output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the same way as in the previous example, you can also save the output
on your screen by typing ``log out filename`` (the file will be an ASCII
file called ``filename.out``). You can close the file with
``log close out``. This command is very useful to save your parameters
and errors.

Quitting the program
--------------------

Just type ``quit`` (see :ref:`sec:quit`).

Tips & Tricks
-------------

-  If you make a typo in a command or you want to do the same command
   again, then push the ``arrow-up`` button on your keyboard. There is
   an entire history of your commands there.

-  The ``Tab`` key is able to automatically complete the command you are
   typing. In case there are more possibilities, it shows them all.
