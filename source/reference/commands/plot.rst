Plot: Plotting data and models
==============================

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The plot command cause the plot to be (re)drawn on the graphics device.
Multiple graphics devices can be defined in one SPEX session. For
example, a plot can be sent to both a postscript and a xs device.

A user can also set the number of plot frames in the currently active
device(s), e.g. the data and model can be displayed in one frame while
the residuals can be displayed in a frame below. The user has to specify
what is to be plotted in in each frame.

In each plot frame, there can be different sets that can be specified by
the "set" keyword in the plot command. For example, for the plot type
data, each set corresponds to the spectrum of an instrument or region;
with this option it is therefore possible to give different instruments
different colours or plot symbols, etc., or just to omit one of the
instruments from the plot.

The plot command is also used to select the axis plot units and scales
as well as character commands like font style, line weights, plot
colours, etc. Finally, the plot command can also be used to dump the
data to an ascii file.

.. warning:: To make a plot, always start with a ``plot device`` command
   to open any plot device you wish. Next select a plot type using ``plot
   type``. After this you can give any plot commands to modify or display
   the plot.

.. warning:: Some of the more fancy plotting options, like adding
   labels to a plot, are broken. To make more sophisticated plots, it is
   advisable to save the plot to a QDP file with ``plot adum`` and adapt them
   through QDP (Ftools). We intent to update the plotting system in a
   future version of SPEX.

Syntax
~~~~~~

The following syntax rules apply for plot:

| ``plot`` : (Re)draws the plot on the graphics device. Take care to
  open at least one device first (with a "plot dev" command)
| ``plot frame new`` : Creates a new additional plot frame, where an
  other plot type can be displayed (or the same plot type but with
  different units). Take care to position the viewport of the new and
  old frames to the desired locations.
| ``plot frame #i`` : Sets frame number #i to be the currently active
  frame. After this command has been issued, all plot commands will only
  affect the currently active frame.
| ``plot frame delete #i`` : Deletes frame number #i.
| ``plot type #a`` : Specifies what is to be plotted in the selected
  frame. #a can be any of the plot types specified in
  :ref:`sect:plottypes`.
| ``plot device #a1 [#a2]`` : Selects a graphics device #a1 and optional
  file name #a2 (in the case of a postscript or gif device). File
  extensions (for example .ps) should be specified. For valid devices,
  see :ref:`sect:plotdevices`.
| ``plot close #i`` : Close graphics device number #i. Note, always
  close a postscript device before quiting /spex, otherwise the contents
  may be corrupted.
| ``plot hlan`` : Make a hardcopy in landscape orientation and send it
  to the standard printer. Use is made of the unix command ``lp -c
  filename``.
| ``plot hpor`` : As above, but for portrait orientation
| ``plot x lin`` : Plot the x-axis on a linear scale
| ``plot x log`` : Plot the x-axis on a log scale
| ``plot y lin`` : Plot the y-axis on a linear scale
| ``plot y log`` : Plot the y-axis on a log scale
| ``plot y mix #r1 #r2`` : Plot the y-axis on a mixed linear/logarithmic
  scale; for y-values below #r1 the data will be plotted linear, and for
  y-values above #r1 the data will be plotted logarithmically; the
  linear part occupies the fraction of the total frame height given by
  #r2. See also :ref:`sect:plotscales`.
| ``plot z lin`` : Plot the z-axis on a linear scale. The z-axis is
  defined for two-dimensional plots like contour plots.
| ``plot z log`` : As above, but using a log scale.
| ``plot ux #a`` : Set the plot units on the x-axis, #a can be Å, keV,
  eV, or whatever unit that is allowed. The allowed values depend upon
  the plot type. See :ref:`sect:plotaxes` for
  allowed units for each plot type.
| ``plot ux vel #r #a`` : Plot the x-axis in velocity units
  (:math:`\mathrm{km}` :math:`\mathrm{s}^{-1}`), with reference energy provided as #r if #a is
  "keV" or reference wavelength provided as #r if #a is "Ang". Note that
  the same zero scale will be set for all plot windows.

  used. For #l is false, the default viewport is overruled and you can
  specify your own viewport limits with the ``set view x`` and ``set view
  y`` commands. Useful for stacking different plot frames.
| ``plot view x #r1:#r2`` : Set the x viewport range from #r1 to #r2,
  where #r1 and #r2 must be in the range 0–1.
| ``plot view y #r1:#r2`` : Same as above, but for the y-range.

  #i. See Section :ref:`sect:plotcolours` for the
  allowed plot colours.

  transparent, the plot frame will be shown with the background colour
  selected by the ``plot view back`` command. Default is false.
| ``plot box disp #l`` : Display a box around the viewport, true/false
| ``plot box edge #a #l`` : If true (default), display the edges of the
  plot box, #a should be one of the following keywords: top, bottom,
  left, right. Note that whether you see the edges or not also depends
  on the settings defined by the ``plot box disp`` command.
| ``plot box axis x #l`` : Plots an x-axis with tick marks at the line

  plot in an ascii file with filename #a. The extension ".qdp" will
  automatically be appended. Note that the data will be written as they
  are, i.e. if you have a logarithmic x-axis or y-axis, the logs of the
  plotted quantities will be written. If you want to replot your data
  later with for example the qdp package, take care that you plot the
  data in SPEX on a lin-lin frame before you execute the "plot adum"
  command. Also note that the data will be written in the units that
  were specified in the plot (energy, wavelength or whatever is
  applicable). The output format is described in :ref:`sect:plotadum`.
  If the optional "append" keyword is present, the data will
  be appended to any existing file with the name #a; if the optional
  "overwrite" keyword is present, any pre-existing file with the name #a
  will be overwritten by the new data.
