Var: various settings for the plasma models
===========================================

Overview
--------

For the plasma models, there are several quantities that have useful
default values but can be adjusted manually for specific purposes. We
list them below.

Free-bound emission
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Usually the freebound emission takes most of the computing time for the
plasma models. This is because it needs to be evaluated for all
energies, ions and atomic sublevels that are relevant. In order to reduce
the computational burden, there is a parameter gfbacc in SPEX that is
approximately the accuracy level for the free-bound calculation. The
default value is :math:`10^{-3}`. If this quantity is higher, less
shells are taken into account and the computation proceeds faster (but
less accurate). The users are advised not to change this parameter
unless they are knowing what they do!

Line emission contributions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, all possible line emission processes are taken into account
in the plasma models. For testing purposes, it is possible to include or
exclude specific contributions. These are listed below in
the table below.

.. table:: Possible line emission processes

   =========== =====================================
   Abbrevation Process
   =========== =====================================
   ex          electron excitation
   rr          radiative recombination
   dr          dielectronic recombination
   ds          dielectronic recombination satellites
   ii          inner shell ionisation
   =========== =====================================

Doppler broadening
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, thermal Doppler broadening is taken into account. However,
the user can put this off for testing purposes. The options for the
broadening are:

#. No broadening at all

#. Only Doppler broadening (default)

#. Only natural broadening (works only for *var calc new*)

#. Doppler and natural broadening, Voigt profiles (best physical
   representation, works only for *var calc new*)

Atomic data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The user can choose between the "old" Mekal code (the current default,
also referred to as SPEXACT v2), the updated calculations with the
command ``var calc new`` (referred to as SPEXACT v3), and a "quick-cie"
mode with the command ``var calc qc``.

The quick CIE mode is designed only for CIE-family models, including
*cie*, *dem*, *pdem*, *wdem*, *cf*, and *clus*. It is not compatible with
non-equilibrium scenarios like *nei* or any cases involving photon fields,
like *pion*, *tpho*, and *xabs*.

Calculation level occupations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the new line calculations, the occupation of the different atomic
energy levels is determined self-consistently. Consider an ion for which
we want to determine these occupations. If the occupation of the
different levels of all neighbouring ions is known, then given our
atomic database we know all the rates we need to calculate in one step
the level occupations of our ion. However, our initial guess of the
occupation of the neighbours may have been not correct, therefore the
rates are not correct, and we need to iterate a few times before all
ions of an element are converged. This usually takes between 2 and about
25 iterations, depending on the precise physical conditions.

As starting values we assume that all ions are in the ground state, and
then we iterate (this is the default mode). By setting ``var occstart
boltzmann``, we can change this to an initial Boltzmann distribution for
the occupation. This may be more appropriate for very high density
plasmas. To reduce the number of iterations, one may also start with
``var occstart last``, in which case the results from the last calculation
are used as starting values. This can be useful for spectral fitting
and/or error searches, where for each call the parameters of the model
are close to those for the previous call.

.. Warning:: The ``var occstart last`` option will have limited advantage
   if the model during a fit is far off from the final values (large
   parameter changes during fitting), or with multiple components (in which
   case the last parameters stored in the newlin subroutine may be
   associated to a different spectral component compared to the one
   studied).

Mekal code
~~~~~~~~~~

Over the years, we have made several minor improvements to the original Mekal plasma
model. These improvements are included by default. However, it is
possible to discard some of these improvements by going back to the old
code. The improvements are classified as follows (with the appropriate
syntax word added here).

``Wav:`` wavelength corrections according to the work of
`Phillips et al. (1999) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1999A%26AS..138..381P/abstract>`_,
based upon Solar flare spectra; in addition, the 1s-np wavelengths of
Ni XXVII and Ni XXVIII have been improved.

``Fe17:`` The strongest Fe XVII lines are corrected in order to agree with
the rates as calculated by `Doron & Behar (2002)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002ApJ...574..518D/abstract>`_.

``Update:`` several minor corrections: the Si IX C7 line has been deleted;
the Si VIII N6 line now only has the 319.83 Å line strength instead of
the total triplet strength; the Ni XVIII and Fe XVI Na1A and NA1B lines
plus their satellites have been deleted.

Cooling by collisional excitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the oldest version of the *pion* model, for the cooling by
collisional excitation the Mekal code was used, with all processes
except for collisonal excitation on. This has now improved by using a
mixture of more modern data for collisional excitation taken from our
new SPEX calculations, or for ions for which no new data are yet
available, from the Chianti database, and in a few rare cases we still
use the old Mekal data (4 ions only). For a full description see
Stofanova et al. (2020, subm.). This new calculation is now the
default, but the user can switch between both by selecting the ``var
newcoolexc #l`` option.

Cooling by dielectronic recombination
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the oldest version of the *pion* model, cooling by di-electronic
recombination was not included. This has now been corrected. Wherever
available, cooling rates are calculated directly from the di-electronic
recombination model from the latest model, for those ions for which
Auger rates and associated energies are available. For all other ions,
we use the old calculations from the Mekal code (with only the *dr* and
*ds* flags turned on).

The user has the option, however, to use only Mekal data (for
comparison) by setting the command ``var newcooldr false``.

 .. _sec:var_cxcon:

Charge exchange recombination and ionization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The charge exchange recombination and ionization rates can be set either from
`Arnaud and Rothenflug (1985) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1985A&AS...60..425A>`_
or `Kingdon and Ferland (1996) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/192335>`_
using the ``var cxcon`` command.

 1. Use Arnaud and Rothenflug rates for charge exchange recombination and ionization (``var cxcon 1``).
 2. Use Kingdon and Ferland rates for charge exchange recombination and ionization (``var cxcon 2``).

Default rates are Kingdon and Ferland.

 .. _sec:var_pixsec:

Photoionization cross sections 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The photoionization cross section in the balance calculation, and the relevant
photoabsorption continuum and the free-bound emission, can be set either from
the `OPEN-ADAS database <https://open.adas.ac.uk/>`_ or by the classical recipe
which involves `Verner et al. (1996) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996ApJ...465..487V/abstract>`_
for the photoionization/photoabsorption and
`Mao et al. (2016) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...587A..84M/abstract>`_
for the free-bound emission. This option is available with the ``var pixsec`` command.

1. Use Verner for photoionization/photoabsorption and Mao for free-bound (``var pixsec 1``).
2. Use OPEN-ADAS for all (``var pixsec 2``).

Default rates are OPEN-ADAS. With this option the photoexcitation-autoionization resonances are evaluated in
the balance calculation.
