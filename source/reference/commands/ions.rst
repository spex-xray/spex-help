Ion: select ions for the plasma models
======================================

.. highlight:: none

Overview
--------

For the plasma models, it is possible to include or exclude specific
groups of ions from the line calculations. This is helpful if a better
physical understanding of the (atomic) physics behind the spectrum is
requested.

In addition, there is an option to mute particular lines in the spectrum
for specific analysis purposes.

There are two main reasons why the user may use this option: computational speed
and educational reasons. 

Computational speed
'''''''''''''''''''

The first reason is **accelerating the calculations**. For complex spectral models, 
the computational time may be long due to the large number of ions and transitions
that need to be taken into account, in particular for the line calculations.

By reducing the number of ions in the calculation, or using a maximum principal
quantum number, or other reductions, allow to make the calculations faster by simply
skipping the line emission from those transitions. Note that obviously this leads
to less accurate spectra as compared to the full calculation. Technically,
it is done by using the "ions ignore ..." or "ions use ..." commands (for getting
rid of, or including line emission from specific ions), or the "ions nmax ..." or 
"ions lmax ..." commands, to reduce the maximum principal quantum number 
:math:`n` and the maximum orbital quantum number :math:`l`, respectively.
Also, by using the "ions new ...", "ions qc ...", and "ions old ..." commands
one may switch between the default (new) spex calculations, the quick-cie mode,
and the (old) *mekal* calculations.
See :ref:`sect:performance` for more details.

A minor note must be made here: when excluding a single ion, the calculations
becomes less accurate, because level populations of ions depend also on how many
ionisations or recombinations occur from levels of neighbouring ions. By ignoring
an ion, it also cannot contribute to its neighbours.

Currently these settings *only* affect the line emission; in the
calculation of the ionisation balance as well as the continuum always
all ions are taken into account (unless of course the abundance is put
to zero).

Diagnostics & education
'''''''''''''''''''''''

The second reason to include or exclude ions is for 
**diagnostic or educational reasons**. It may be of interest to know how the spectrum
of a single ion looks, or how the total spectrum would look without an ion.
For such cases, SPEX has the "ions mute ..." or its inverse "ions unmute ..."
commands. 

Contrary to the use/ignore commands, with this command the full spectrum
is calculated, and only at the last step the contribution of the ion is muted or
unmuted. Also, contrary to the use/ignore commands, this option works on the
full spectrum (continuum and lines, both in emission and absorption). Finally,
take care when combining the use/ignore with the mute/unmute commands.
Whenever you ignore an ion, it will not be calculated and in those cases the
mute or unmute commands are not effective.

Finally, when you use the mute/unmute commands, it will also affect the ascii
output for a few important output options, like the "line" and "tra" options for
line emission or absorption.

.. warning:: When using the pion model with this option, you will get a different
   solution, because it affects the heating and cooling rates, and thus the
   ionisation balance (equilibrium temperature).
   Exception is when you use the tmod=1 option for pion, which forces the
   temperature to be equal to what you prescribe through parameter tinp.
   For diagnosing the heating/cooling contributions of ions or elements, it is
   therefore recommended to run first the model with all ions,
   make an ascii-output of the plasma parameters, take the temperature from
   there as the "tinp" parameter, and set tmod=1.
   You can play then with the mute/unmute command.

Quicklook
'''''''''

A new **quicklook mode** is introduced in SPEX 3.0. This mode can greatly
reduce computation time by excluding the atomic levels of outer shells
that barely affect the obtained spectrum. The maximum quantum numbers
:math:`n` and :math:`l` of Hydrogen-like ions are provided in
the table below.

The quicklook mode is enabled by the command::

    SPEX> ions ql

To undo the quicklook mode, just type ``ions use all``.

.. warning:: This mode will not work for CX model, since electron
             captured by charge exchange usually populate the outer shells.

.. table:: Preset maximum :math:`n` and :math:`l` for quicklook mode (H-like)

.. Note:: the quicklook mode is different from the quick CIE mode set by ``ions qc`` or ``var calc qc``.

QC mode
'''''''
QC, or the **quick cie** mode, is introduced in SPEX v3.08 for a quick evalulation of CIE-family models, including
*CIE*, *dem*, *pdem*, *wdem*, *cf*, and *clus*. This mode can be turned on and off for individual ions or elements.

.. Note:: ``ion qc`` is only valid when the system flag ``var calc`` is set to ``new`` or ``qc``.

Ewlim
'''''

An alternative, tunable method to reduce the computation time is the **ewlim mode**. For a grid of temperatures and non-equilibrium
ionisation or recombination parameters, for each spectral line in SPEX the maximum equivalent width :math:`W` has been computed. 
The equivalent width is here the line intensity divided by the continuum intensity for the same model. From this, we compute for each line
:math:`Q = W/E` with E the energy of the line. This is a measure of the relative intensity of the line for a given spectral resolution.
Further, for each line we register the maximum principal quantum number :math:`n`.

The user now can select a critical value for :math:`Q_c` (or actually, the 10log of this quantity). Now for each principal quantum number,
we check whether there is any line with :math:`Q>Q_c`. If so, all lines with this principal quantum number are retained, but if none of thelines is tronger than the threshold, we will discard lines from that pricipal quantum number. In this way we determine the maximum principal quantum number for each ion,
given the value for :math:`Q_c`. Higher values for :math:`Q_c` means less lines, because more lines will be deemed to be too weak.

A performance test shows that a speed gain of a factor of 2-3 gan be reached with this method. It is in particular useful for error searches on
parameter values. Try experimenting with this.

.. warning:: it is advised, after obtaining a best fit with some setting of ewlim, to set the parameter ewlim to -25 (including all lines), issue
   a calculate command, and compare the cstat value of this model with the cstat value of your fit. Dicide if this is good enough for your purpose.

Mute lines
''''''''''

A new feature since version 3.06.01 is the line mute command. In some cases,
when users what to study a particular line, they want to remove the line
from the spectrum to replace it, for example, with a delta line or Gaussian.

The ``ions mute line`` command allows to mute up to 10 spectral lines
identified from the ``asc ter line`` output. Please note that this command
only works for SPEXACT v3 (``var calc new``). When SPEXACT v3 is enabled, the
``ascdump line`` command (:ref:`sec:ascdump`) will show a line list with line
id numbers::

      1   O  VIII   1s 2S1/2                         - 2p 2P1/2                        0.6534939       18.97252      1.418E+42  1.689E-06  3.957E-04
      2   O  VIII   1s 2S1/2                         - 2s 2S1/2                        0.6535030       18.97225      1.011E+39  1.419E-12  3.957E-04
      3   O  VIII   1s 2S1/2                         - 2p 2P3/2                        0.6536802       18.96711      2.834E+42  1.691E-06  3.958E-04

In the example of O VIII above, the line id is listed as an integer in the first
column before O VIII. To not show the O VIII Lya lines in the spectrum, they can
be muted with the command::

    SPEX> ions mute line 1 ion 8 8
    SPEX> ions mute line 3 ion 8 8

Where the number behind ``line`` is the line id, and the numbers behind ``ion``
are the atomic number and ionisation stage, respectively. If necessary, the
lines can be unmuted with the ``ions unmute line`` command which has a very
similar syntax.
