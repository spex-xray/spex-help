CX: model for charge exchange plasmas
=====================================

This model calculates the spectrum emitted from a hot plasma when it
recombines with cold neutral materials. This model is based on three key
assumptions: (1) it considers only single electron capture in a
ion-neutral collision; (2) all cross section data are obtained only with a
atomic hydrogen target, (3) electronic collisional excitation and
recombination are ignored in the spectral calculation. More information
can be found in `Gu et al. (2016) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...588A..52G/abstract>`_.


Charge exchange cross sections
------------------------------

The CX cross section data used in the model are partly taken from
literature, including quantum molecular-orbital close-coupling
calculations for :math:`\mathrm C^{5+}` and :math:`\mathrm O^{6+}` by
`Wu et al. (2012) <https://doi.org/10.1088/0953-4075/45/23/235201>`_
and `Nolte et al. (2012) <https://doi.org/10.1088/0953-4075/45/24/245202>`_,
multi-channel Laudau-Zener results for :math:`\mathrm Fe^{25+}` and
:math:`\mathrm Fe^{26+}` by `Mullen et al. (2016)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJS..224...31M/abstract>`_, other data
compilations for :math:`\mathrm C^{6+}` and :math:`\mathrm O^{8+}` by
`Janev et al. (1993) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1993ADNDT..55..201J/abstract>`_,
and the NIFS Charge Transfer Database
(CHART)  [1]_ for :math:`\mathrm Be^{4+}`, :math:`\mathrm B^{5+}`,
:math:`\mathrm N^{7+}`, and :math:`\mathrm Ne^{10+}`. For CHART database, we
extracted all the data, from both theoretical calculations and
experiments (see a full list in Table 1 of `Gu et al. (2016)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...588A..52G/abstract>`_),
and fitted them with Eq.2 of `Gu et al. (2016)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...588A..52G/abstract>`_ in the energy
range of interests. In typical astrophysical velocity range
(:math:`\sim 100-5000` km :math:`\mathrm{s}^{-1}`), the useful CHART data are
usually from molecular-orbital and atomic-orbital close-coupling
methods, and a few classical trajectory Monte Carlo calculations. All
the above data are dependent on collision energy, and resolved to levels
described by quantum number :math:`n` and :math:`l`.

For ions not available in public sources, we developed a new method to
interpolate by analyzing the known ions. First we used a scaling law to
determine total cross section for each ion, and applied another scaling
law to represent the :math:`n-` selectivity. The :math:`l-` dependence
is approximated by one of the five empirical weighting functions
presented in Eqs.\ :math:`4-8` of `Gu et al. (2016)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...588A..52G/abstract>`_.

.. Warning:: The CX model only works with the updated atomic database set
   through the command ``var calc new``.

.. Warning:: All Beryllium-like sequence ions are not included in the
   current version; will be available later.

.. Warning:: We will keep updating the CX model when new data
   (especially for molecular targets) from theoretical calculations and
   experiments become available.

Parameter description
---------------------

The parameters of the CX model are:

| ``norm`` : the normalisation, which is the emission measure
  :math:`Y \equiv n_{\mathrm H} n_{\mathrm nh} V` in units of
  :math:`10^{64}` :math:`\mathrm{m}^{-3}`, where
  :math:`n_{\mathrm H}` and :math:`n_{\mathrm nh}` are the Hydrogen
  densities of the ionized and neutral materials, respectively, and
  :math:`V` is the effective interaction volume. Default value: 1.
| ``hden`` : Hydrogen density of the neutral materials in units of
  :math:`10^{20}` :math:`\mathrm{m}^{-3}` (or :math:`10^{14}`
  :math:`\mathrm{m}^{-3}`).
  Default value: :math:`10^{-14}`.
| ``mode`` : Switch between a hot-cold interaction driven by thermal
  motion of hot plasma, and the one dominated by flow velocity. Default
  value: 2 (kinematic).
| ``t`` : the ionization temperature of hot matter in keV. It is also
  used to approximate the thermal motion when mode is set to 1. Default
  value: 1.
| ``sig`` : the width :math:`\sigma_T` of the gaussian emission measure
  profile. Default value: 0. (no temperature distribution i.e.
  isothermal)
| ``sup`` : the width :math:`\sigma_T` of the high-temperature part of
  the gaussian emission measure profile. If larger than :math:`10^{-5}`
  keV, the sig parameter becomes the sigma value for the low-temperature
  end. Default value: 0
| ``logt`` : Switch between linear and logarithmic temperature scale for
  the gaussian emission measure profile. Default value: 1 (logarithmic)
| ``zv`` : Collision velocity in unit of km :math:`\mathrm{s}^{-1}`, used when
  mode is set to 2. Default value: 100
| ``op`` : Switch between single and multiple collisions for each ion.
  In multiple collision case, one ion would continuously undergo CX and
  produce various emission lines, until it becomes neutral. Default: 1
  (single)
| ``wt`` : Weighting functions for subshell :math:`l-` population. When
  wt is set to 1, the :math:`l-` population is approximated by a series
  of empirical functions that switchs from one to another as a function
  of collision velocity. See `Gu et al. (2016)
  <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...588A..52G/abstract>`_ for details.
  These empirical functions are defined in Eqs. :math:`4-8` of
  `Gu et al. (2016) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...588A..52G/abstract>`_,
  and will be selected when wt is set to :math:`2-6`, respectively. Default: 1
| ``vrms`` : RMS Velocity broadening in km/s (see :ref:`sect:turbulence`)
| ``ref`` : reference element. Default value 1 (hydrogen). See above for
  more details. The value corresponds to the atomic number of the
  reference element.
| ``01`` : Abundance of hydrogen (H, Z=1) in Solar units. Default 1.
| ``02`` : Abundance of helium (He, Z=2) in Solar units. Default 1.
| :math:`\ldots` ``30`` : Abundance of zinc (Zn, Z=30) in Solar units.
  Default 1.
| ``file`` : Filename for the nonthermal distribution. If not present,
  nonthermal effects are not taken into account (default).
