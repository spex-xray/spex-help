Speith: relativistic line broadening model
This multiplicative model broadens an arbitrary additive component with
a relativistic line profile. The relativistic line profile is based
on the theory of transfer functions as presented by Cunningham (1975) 
and worked out in a fortran code by Ronald Speith (xxxx).

The original code by Speith has three important issues. First, the computation
of all transfer function values needed for a full integration over a disk is
computational expensive. Therefore we have pre-calculated the transfer function
for a grid of black hole spin a and inclination i values.


interpolated from tables produced by Laor (1991). In
his model, the line transfer function is determined for emission from
the equatorial plane around a Kerr black hole, assuming an emissivity
law I(\cos\theta) \sim 1. +
2.06\cos\theta. The transfer function is calculated at a grid of 35
radii (r_n = 1600 / (n+1)^2 for n=1,\ldots,35, in units
of GM/c^2), 31 inclinations uniformly spaced in \cos i,
and 300 frequencies, logarithmically spaced between 0.1 and 5 times the
emission frequency, respectively.
Using these numbers, a radial integration is done using an emissivity
law
I(r) \sim 1 / (r^2 + h^2)^{q/2},

where h is a characteristic scale height and q an
asymptotic power law index (for large r,
I(r)\sim r^{-q}). The integration is done between an inner
radius r_1 and an outer radius r_2. Given the radial
grid that is provided in Laorâ€™s data, the outer radius extends out to at
most 400GM/c^2.

Warning
Of course, any line or continuum emission component can be
convolved with the this broadening model; for continuum components the
computational time may be very large, however, due to the convolution
involved.


Warning
The outer radius cannot be larger than 400GM/c^2.

The parameters of the model are:


r1 : Inner radius of the disk, in units of GM/c^2. The
minimum allowed value is 1.234 (for a maximally rotating Kerr black
hole). For a Schwarzschild black hole, one should take
r_i = 6. Default value: 1.234.

r2 : Outer radius of the disk, in units of GM/c^2. Keep
this radius less than 400 (default value)

q : Emissivity slope q as described above. Default value:
2.

h : Emissivity scale height. Default value: 0.

i : Inclination angle (in degrees) of the disk (angle between line
of sight and the rotation axis of the disk). Default value: 45
degrees.
