Dabs: dust absorption model
===========================

This model allows the user to make a zeroth order approximation to the
effects of dust on an X-ray absorption spectrum. Basically, compared to
absorption by atomic gas, the effects of dust are two-fold:

-  Modifications to the fine structure near the edge

-  Reduced opacity due to self-shielding in grains

The *dabs* model only accounts for the second effect, reduced opacity
due to self-shielding. The formalism of `Wilms et al. (2000)
<https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...542..914W/abstract>`_
is followed, and we refer to that paper for a full explanation.

In the set of abundances, we use the depletion factors of
`Wilms et al. (2000) <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000ApJ...542..914W/abstract>`_.

The numbers represent the fraction of the atoms that are bound in dust
grains. Noble gases like Ne and Ar are chemically inert hence are
generally not bound in dust grains, but other elements like Ca exist
predominantly in dust grains.

.. warning:: For a realistic model, it is advised to combine the *dabs*
   model with a *hot* model, where (for Solar abundances), the hot model
   should contain the elements *not* bound in the dust.

.. note:: Finally, we note that the *amol* model can deal with the modified
   structure near the oxygen edge, but that model does not take
   self-shielding into account.

The parameters of the model are:

| ``nh`` : Nominal hydrogen column density in
  :math:`10^{28}` :math:`\mathrm{m}^{-2}`. Default value: :math:`1`.
| ``amin`` : Minimum grain size in :math:`\mu`\ m. Default value: 0.025.
| ``amax`` : Minimum grain size in :math:`\mu`\ m. Default value: 0.25.
| ``p`` : Power index grain size distribution. Default value: 3.5.
| ``rho`` : Mean density of the grains in units of
  1000 kg :math:`\mathrm{m}^{-3}`. Default value: 3.
| ``ref`` : Reference atom. Default value: 3 (Lithium). because dust,
  according to the depletion factors used, does not contain hydrogen, we
  substitute here formally Lithium. The user is advisednot to change
  this.
| ``01...30`` : Abundances of H to Zn. See the remark on depletion
  factors above.
| The following parameters are common to all our absorption models:
|  ``icov`` : The shape type of the covering factor. Default value 2 (constant). See :ref:`sect:abs_models` for details.
|  ``fcov`` : The covering factor (at high energy) of the absorber. Default value: 1 (full covering)
|  ``lcov`` : The covering factor (at low energy) of the absorber. Default value: 1 (full
  covering)
|  ``ecov`` : The energy parameter of the transition from low-energy to high-energy covering factor (keV). Default value: 1 (full
  covering)
|  ``acov`` : The width parameter of the covering factor transition from low to high energies. Default value: 1
| ``zv`` : Average systematic velocity :math:`v` of the absorber (using relativistic Doppler shift)
